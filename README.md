# rinha_gleam - Rinha de Backend 2025

This project is my attempt to implement the challenge proposed by Rinha de Backend 2025 in a beautiful functional programming language that is Gleam.

Since I'm working on this after the challenge finished, the _focus_ of this implementation will be to apply techniques that make this kind of system more maintainable than we usually see. These techniques are:

> [TDD](https://tidyfirst.substack.com/p/canon-tdd)

> Functional Programming

> [Vertical Slices Architecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PAGtLwOH4Y)

I'll try my best to run the test with a server that is as close to the challenge's server as possible, but beating the other implementations is a non-goal now.

## Development

```sh
gleam run   # Run the project
gleam test  # Run the tests
```
